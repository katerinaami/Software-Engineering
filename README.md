# Software-Engineering

The goal is to implement a software development project on a smaller scale. In order for this to happen, our team needs to come to terms with the concept of planning, aka time scheduling, risk analysis etc. Afterwards, we will proceed to the phase of analysing the requirements of our project continuing with an initial and detailed design of it and eventually implement the project and make suggestions about testing it.

Main idea: Implement a software for a hospital using an object-oriented programming (OOP) language and more specifically Python (and PyQt5).
